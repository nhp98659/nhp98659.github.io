<h1 style="color:red; text-align:center">STUDENT GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION</h1>
<h2 style="font-family:verdana;text-align:center"> <big> FIRST-YEAR FORUM</big> </h2>
<p> <small> UGA <strong> <A href="https://sga.uga.edu/content_page/first-year-programs">Student Government Association</A> </strong> is a student organization meant for improving the university and listening to the voices of the students. Within SGA, I applied for a first-year program called <strong>First-Year Forum</strong> and after an interview process, I was selected to be a part of student government. Forum is made up of 100 first-year UGA students and 14 peer-advisors. 7 groups are made and 2 peer-advisors lead one group of about 14-15 first-year students. There are three directors of Forum who lead the topic of discussion during the weekly meetings on Mondays. The sole purpose of Forum is to do community service sustainably as well as develop first-years to be servant leaders. Each small group volunteers and serves the community as a group with the peer-advisors having the role of a mentor or guide. Forum has become a large part of my life as a freshman at UGA because of the friendships that I have made and the community service I have been fortunate to take part of.</small> </p>
<p> <small> My Forum small-group is called the <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">yo-yo yellows</span> as our groups color is yellow. Other groups have different colors such as another group having the color green being "Money Gang". My small group's peer-advisors are Lillie and TJ where Lillie is a third-year and TJ is a second-year. They act as our small group leaders and volunteer with us as they build us into servant leaders for the future. TJ was in Forum last year and Lillie did Forum two years ago. The directors decided to group various Forumers into groups that would include all types of people. There are firt-years who are quiet and reserved while there are others who are extroverted. I consider myself to be in the extroverted category as I like to meet new people and have a very optimistic attitude. Here is a list of the names of my small group. </small> </p> 
<p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FFFF00; padding: 1em;"> Lille, TJ, Nishant, Jack, Sarah, Megan, Eisha, Ryan, Kurt, Kyleigh, Clare, Tea, William, Jessie, Camille, Chandler </p>
<p> <small> An example of the service that we do is volunteering at Thomas Lay. We went to the Thomas Lay center and volunteered as mentors for the Athens-Clarke kids after school. We were paired up with a kid and our job was to have them do their homework and help them if needed. Then we were supposed to have them read for 20-30 minutes and every time they were distracted, we would pause the timer to make sure they truley read for the whole time. After their homework and reading was done we play with them in the gym and play various games such as basketball or soccer. This experience was great as I was able to connect with the kids of Athens and volunteer at Thomas Lay. I intend to continue volunteering there because I was able help children and be a mentor. </small> </p>
